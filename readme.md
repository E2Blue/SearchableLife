Functionality:

Content:
simple html formated text that can be tagged for retrieval.

Media:
Video and images, also taggable.

Tag:
Simply a text string that sort of categorises content.
Perhaps a tag should be able to be added to menus and contains descriptions and such? Or should that be up to a tag aggregator with a single tag?

TagAggregator:
Contains one or more tags and html formatted content. Used for combining different contents tagged with the correct tags, ie Malta2011 + Travel.
Not really thought through yet. Can be added to menus for easy access.
Decide wether content have to have all the specified tags or if it should select content that has any of the tags.
